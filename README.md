Diamonds Prediction - ML Regression
Overview
This project focuses on predicting diamond prices using machine learning regression techniques. We use features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other attributes to train and evaluate different models.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Model evaluation and comparison

Results
Models achieved an RÂ² score of up to 98% 

Random Forest performed better than simple Linear Regression
